# Football-data-analysis uses two dataset; player and player attributes
The keynote in this in this analysis; a data analyst starts his analysis career by taking a look at one of the best Players in football and how his abilities has increased or decreased over the years. 
Some limitations were faced while doing this project. Not being a football fan might affect your ability to understand some abbreviation in the analysis.
This is my first coding attempt, please be nice ^_^^_^
